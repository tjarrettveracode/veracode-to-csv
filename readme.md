# Run

    python veracodetocsv/veracodetocsv.py
    
A text file `processed_builds.txt` keeps track of which builds have been successfully processed. Delete this file to regenerate all CSVs.

# Splunk

`\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\s\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}[+-]\d{2}:\d{2}","` can be used as a TIME_PREFIX in props.conf to extract the build_published_date as an event timestamp
